# Overview

This is a list of acronyms in VA today.

[Patrick Bateman](patrick.bateman@va.gov) maintains a [Slack slash command](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) for the DSVA team that depends on this list. It was inspired by a previous integration of the [/wtf Slack bot](https://github.com/paultag/wtf), formerly maintained by Chris Given.

## Clean up

The terms can be cleaned up for duplicates and sorted via the cleanup script.

Run it via `sh clean.sh`. An output.csv file will be generated that you can replace the acronyms.csv file with.
